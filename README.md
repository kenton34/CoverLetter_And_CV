Dear Madam/Sir:

I have worked on hundreds of vehicle, mechanical, and satellite patent applications, have years of experience counseling diverse-technology clients on intellectual property (IP) portfolio management issues including freedom to operate, invention mining, and patentability, have counseled many of these entities as their only attorney effectively serving as in-house counsel, have worked closely with in-house counsel of large companies on sundry matters including world-wide IP campaigns, antitrust, and trade secret identification, protection, and disputes, and have drafted and negotiated dozens of commercial agreements.

My transactional, prosecution, and litigation experience covers the fields of: robotics, complex Integrated Circuits (ICs), structural systems, artificial intelligence (AI), artificial general intelligence (AGI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality (AR), optics, virtual reality (VR), control systems, computer architecture, fly-by-wire control, Internet of Things (IoT), IC and semiconductor memories (e.g., DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash solid-state drives and modules), propulsion engines, aircraft and automobile navigation systems, physics, signal processing, communication protocols (e.g., 5G NR, LTE, UMTS, GSM, 802.11, etc.), business methods, e-commerce, consumer products, fashion/apparel, media/entertainment, social media, and related topics.  I stay current on many of the above disciplines as a hobby.

Additionally, I have experience in all aspects of patent prosecution (including hundreds of foreign matters), IP monetization (including patent acquisitions, litigation, Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs), design patents, trademarks, copyrights, cybersecurity, data privacy, risk assessment, opposition proceedings, due diligence, deal negotiation, and M&A counseling), invalidity and non-infringement opinions, and transactions such as those involving: assignment and development of technology, distribution of products, and provision of services. 

Further, my background is replete with government and transactional work including drafting, negotiating, and advising on asset purchase/sale, license, merger, joint venture, partnership, investment, inter-company, confidentiality, transition services, and engagement agreements; letters of intent; bid letters; and term sheets. 

I have about 1000 hours of experience in developing code at a corporation, another 1000 hours developing code in other contexts, and have used (and advised clients on) open-source software for decades.  My CLE training covers open-source software legal issues and my engineering experience included generating assembly-language software to control wellbore apparatuses, zonal equipment, and drilling guidance systems.  Additionally, I worked as a Patent Examiner at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the vehicle, device, software transactions, distributed networks, and computing arts.

Please peruse the attached resume and let me know if interest exists in us working together.

With sincere regards, 
 
Kenton R. Mullins
