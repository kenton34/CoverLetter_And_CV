Dear Madam/Sir:

I have worked on hundreds of vehicle, mechanical, and satellite patent applications, have years of experience counseling diverse-technology clients on intellectual property (IP) portfolio management issues including freedom to operate, invention mining, and patentability, have counseled many of these entities as their only attorney effectively serving as in-house counsel, have worked closely with in-house counsel of large companies on sundry matters including world-wide IP campaigns, antitrust, and trade secret identification, protection, and disputes, and have drafted and negotiated dozens of commercial agreements.

My transactional, prosecution, and litigation experience covers the fields of: robotics, complex Integrated Circuits (ICs), structural systems, artificial intelligence (AI), artificial general intelligence (AGI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality (AR), optics, virtual reality (VR), control systems, computer architecture, fly-by-wire control, Internet of Things (IoT), IC and semiconductor memories (e.g., DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash solid-state drives and modules), propulsion engines, aircraft and automobile navigation systems, physics, signal processing, communication protocols (e.g., 5G NR, LTE, UMTS, GSM, 802.11, etc.), business methods, e-commerce, consumer products, fashion/apparel, media/entertainment, social media, and related topics.  I stay current on many of the above disciplines as a hobby.

Additionally, I have experience in all functional aspects of utility patent, design patent, and trademark / service mark prosecution (including hundreds of U.S. and foreign filings of each); IP monetization (i.e., patent acquisitions, notice letters, Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs), trade dress, copyrights, branding, marketing, domain names, product launch, data privacy, cybersecurity, risk assessment, antitrust, oppositions, due diligence, deal negotiation, and M&A counseling); invalidity and non-infringement opinions; regulatory compliance; and the assignment, development, and distribution of technology. 

Further, my background is replete with government and transactional work including drafting, negotiating, and advising on: asset purchase/sale, license, merger, joint venture, partnership, investment, inter-company, engagement, transition services, NDA, and confidentiality agreements; letters of intent; bid letters; and term sheets. I am proficient in managing professional staff and teams, in International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) data privacy, e.g., with respect to CIPP, and in presentation apps including Power Point.

My IP litigation experience includes years of: underlying case analyses; evidence of use (EoU) investigations, e.g., including standard essential patent (SEP) and claim chart analyses; factual/legal research; pleadings; discovery on infringement, validity, and damages; depositions; expert discovery; PTAB and TTAB administrative proceedings; motions; claim construction; and trial related activities.

Also, I have 2000 hours of engineering experience developing software, and have studied, used, and advised clients on open-source software for decades. My clerking experience includes working as a law clerk (with favorable reviews) for: Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner; Blakely Sokoloff Taylor & Zafman; and Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Finally, I worked as a Patent Examiner at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the computer memory, transactions, distributed networks, and cloud computing arts.

Please peruse the attached resume and let me know if interest exists in us working together.

With sincere regards, 
 
Kenton R. Mullins
