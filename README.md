Dear Madam/Sir:

     I have years of experience counseling corporations on IP portfolio management issues including freedom to operate, invention mining, and patentability, have counseled many of these entities as their only attorney effectively serving as in-house counsel, have worked closely with in-house counsel of large companies on sundry matters including world-wide IP assertion campaigns and trade secret disputes, and have drafted and closed dozens of software, Software as a Service (SaaS), Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP), Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), and cloud-based instruments and agreements.
     
     My transactional and prosecution experience covers the fields of: robotics, structural systems, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality (AR), optics, control systems, complex network architectures, financial transactions, Internet of Things (IoT), Integrated Circuits (ICs), medical technologies (e.g., laparoscopic surgery, hospital based treatments, tissue electro-cauterization, cardiac catheterization, dental hard and soft tissue repair, organ transplant, neurological treatments, gastroenterology, surgical spinal alignment, stem cell harvesting and therapies, cryogenics, vessel stents, anti-aging interventions, tumor avoidance/treatment, medical lasers, drug discovery, bioinformatics, ophthalmic lenses, and implants), semiconductor devices (e.g., DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash solid-state drives), aircraft and automobile navigation systems, propulsion engines, physics, signal processing, business methods, wireless communications (e.g., 5G NR, LTE, and 802.11), e-commerce (e.g., involving payments), media/entertainment, consumer products, fashion/apparel, and social media. I endeavor to stay current on many of the above disciplines as a passion filled hobby.
     
     Additionally, I have experience in all functional aspects of patent prosecution (including hundreds of foreign matters), IP monetization (i.e., patent purchase/sale, notice letters, Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs), design patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, domain names, cybersecurity, branding, antitrust, marketing, data privacy, risk assessment, oppositions, cancellations, due diligence, deal negotiation, and M&A counseling), product launch, validity and infringement studies, regulatory compliance, and instruments such as those involving the assignment, development, and distribution of technology and services.
     
     Further, my background is replete with government and transactional work including drafting, negotiating, and advising on: (i) dozens of license, merger, joint venture, partnership, investment, inter-company, engagement, transition services, NDA, and confidentiality agreements, (ii) asset acquisitions, (iii) letters of intent, (iv) bid letters, and (v) term sheets. I am proficient in managing professional staff and teams, in International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) data privacy, e.g., with respect to CIPP, and in presentation apps including Webex and Power Point.
     
     My IP litigation experience includes years of: (i) underlying case analyses, (ii) evidence of use (EoU) investigations, e.g., including standard essential patent (SEP) and claim chart analyses, (iii) factual and legal research, (iv) pleadings, (v) discovery on infringement, validity, and damages, (vi) depositions, (vii) expert discovery, (viii) PTAB and TTAB administrative proceedings, (ix) motions, (x) claim construction, and (xi) trial related activities.
     
     Also, I have about 2000 hours of computer science experience developing software, and have studied, used, and advised clients on open-source software for decades. My clerking experience includes working as a law clerk (with favorable reviews) for: (i) Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, (ii) Blakely Sokoloff Taylor & Zafman, and (iii) Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Finally, I worked as a Patent Examiner at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the computer memory, transactions, IC card, and cloud computing arts.
     
     Please peruse the attached resume and let me know if interest exists in us working together.
     
With sincere regards,

Kenton R. Mullins
